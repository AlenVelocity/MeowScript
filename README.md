# Meowscript 🐾
Meowscript is a.. uhh. Let's just say a cat inspired programming language? (I might need help with this)

</div>

## Features

- **Cat inspired keywords**: Meowscript replaces traditional programming keywords with cat-related terms. Like `purrhaps`, `pawction`, `hiss` ect. (Bonus points if you can guess what these ones do)

- **Paw-some syntax**: Meowscript's syntax is not really designed to be easy to read. But it's fun.. I guess

- **Adorable standard library**: Meowscript comes with a standard library filled with cat-themed functions and utilities. From `scratch` to `meow`, the standard library adds makes your coding experience much cuter 
## Running Locally

To get started with Meowscript, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlenVelocity/MeowScript
cd MeowScript
```

2. **Writing Meowscript Code**: Create a new file with the `.ms` extension and start writing your cueteejnjeejnfkjnwdwnfnqf Meowscript code.

   ```rust
   scratch main = pawction () {
       scratch x = 10;
       scratch y = 5;

       purrhaps (x > y) {
           meow("Meow! x is greater than y!");
       } meowtually {
           meow("Meow! x is not greater than y!");
       }
   };

   main();
   ```

3. **Running Meowscript Code**: For now you have to build your own binary or use cargo to run MeowScript

   ```
   cargo run run your_file.meow
   ```

    > There are 2 'run's 'cause 1st "run" is required by cargo and the 2nd one is for the built binary. This will make much more sense in the future
     
    You can also try the REPL by just running:
    ```
    cargo run
    ```
